        I’m a full-time trader and educator with a focus on <strong>Forex, Gold, and Bitcoin</strong>.
        Over the years, I’ve worked with traders across levels — helping them understand markets without noise,
        without indicators, and without the confusion that holds most people back.
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
        GOFX was built to solve a problem I personally faced early in my journey:
        <strong>too much fluff, too little clarity</strong>. My goal today is simple —
        teach traders how to read the market logically, execute confidently, and grow through a supportive community.
